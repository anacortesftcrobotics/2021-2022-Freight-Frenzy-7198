#### Coach notes
BlueMink now has the local Freight Frenzy repo on the Desktop.

The top level of this repo has a shell command git_tasks.sh. If you have a GitHub account with a personal token, you can check your code into GitHub using this command.

How to call it:
* sh ./2021-2022-Freight-Frenzy-7198/git_tasks.sh run commit
* sh ./2021-2022-Freight-Frenzy-7198/git_tasks.sh run push
* sh ./2021-2022-Freight-Frenzy-7198/git_tasks.sh run commit+push
